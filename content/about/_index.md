# About me

Aspiring AI/ML Engineer passionate about Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, ethical AI, and open data initiatives. I enjoy contributing to projects that promote digital rights and a decentralised internet.

As a BH Futures Foundation alumnus, I'm committed to supporting STEM innovation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, my home country.

## Why blog?

I'll be sharing thoughts on AI/ML, technology, and ideas I find worth exploring. Occasionally, I might just mess about a bit.

Hopefully, this evolves into a useful archive of lessons and insights over time.

## Why GradientFlow?

Many learning algorithms follow gradients - tiny steps towards better understanding. In machine learning, they guide us towards optimal solutions. In life, they guide us towards better versions of ourselves.

This space captures my own gradient descent through AI, technology, and whatever else catches my curiosity.
